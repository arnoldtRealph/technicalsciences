            Technical Sciences support learners in the three focus areas of technology, namely:
            Mechanical, 
            Electrical and 
            Civil Technology.
            Learners at technical schools will be able to integrate scientific knowledge
            in a more informed way in their field of specialization. Scientific concepts and skills 
            will be easier to master if learners have a technical orientation in their schooling.
            Technical Sciences try to address the needs of the industry and 
            the technology subjects by being an enabling subject 
            to promote technology studies in schools.
            Technical Sciences aim to prepare learners for further education and training,
            employment, citizenship, holistic and socio-economic development._""")
